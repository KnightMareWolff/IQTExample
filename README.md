# Welcome to the Blueprint example of the IQT Unreal Plugin.

## This example was created using the Unreal Engine Third Person template and contains code created only in the following Blueprints:

01 - BP_QTaskEnemy - Have the ability to patrol the area.

02 - BP_QTaskLocation - A patrol location to be targeted and processed by the enemy.

03 - GA_Patrol and GA_GotoLocation - That executes a patrol ability.

## To view the example, simply press Play and watch the enemy execute the Patrol Ability in BeginPlay.

### To run this example you must have the IQT - Insane Queue & Task plugin Installed.
